# The Final Data Story
[Link to Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/9Xa2dqQw8LRZeng)


# Changes Made Since Part II
## The Audience
Because the tomato is a ubiquitous food staple, I structured this project for a broad audience rather than a niche group of people. Yet, I believe the following readers will find the story most engaging:

* **Consumers of Tomato Products:** They can follow the full journey of a vegetable they enjoy, from production and global trade to final consumption, by tracing the tomato's supply chain.
* **Agriculture & Horticulture Enthusiasts:** They can deepen their knowledge of the global production and trade scale of tomatoes, with a focus on the United States market.
* **The Generally Curious Reader:** This project can offer a new perspective on an everyday item, providing interesting facts and context often overlooked.

## Final Design Decisions
### Changes to Data Visualizations
1. I reworked the “My Typical Weekly Vegetable Groceries” graph by incorporating vegetable labels at the bottom and frequency labels at the top to enhance comprehension clarity.
2. For the “Gross Tomato Production Around the World in 2022” map, I added the color legend to indicate that a color closer to yellow represents a lower production amount and a color closer to dark red represents a higher production amount.
3. I created 12 more data visualizations to complete my narrative, using the same color scheme (yellow, orange, red, and green from my moodboard in Part 2) to maintain a sense of consistency in stylistic design.
4. I tried to incorporate more visualization types into my project so that I can show data in different ways that effectively convey its messages. For instance, the pie chart was specifically chosen to show the breakdown of each country's exports to the US, as it clearly visualizes the percentage of each commodity in relation to the total. Line charts were specifically used to visualize trends in American consumption of tomatoes throughout the years.

### Changes to Story Structure & Content
The core storyline of this project remained unchanged, as I was only advancing the story by adding findings and insights from the data visualizations I created. However, the one addition to the story was the call-to-action at the very end that features food waste prevention tips from the EPA. This addition was directly influenced by my data findings: the entire analysis suggests that the tomatoes reaching our tables tend to travel long distances from various global locations. When this complex journey is combined with the noticeable gap between Food Availability and LAFA data, which highlights massive loss and waste, I see a clear need for intervention. Since the primary audience for this story is ordinary people who consume tomatoes, concluding with officially credited, actionable tips for reducing home food waste felt like a necessary and effective way to conclude the story.

### Future Improvement
If I were to enhance this project further, I would definitely include a dedicated data visualization to compare the Food Availability and LAFA data directly. This chart will visually highlight the substantial tomato loss and waste, represented by the difference between the two datasets, which helps to better convey my final message and create a much smoother transition into my call-to-action at the end.

# AI acknowledgements
I used Gemini to help instruct me on creating data visualizations in Tableau and Datawrapper, and to help rephrase some of my writing on Shorthand in a more conversational and interesting way. For this write-up, I used Grammarly to check my spelling and grammar.


# Final thoughts
I really enjoyed developing this final project from scratch, outlining the core narrative, finding supporting data to visualize the insights, and presenting the story on an interactive webpage. Although settling on a topic and cleaning the raw datasets took some time, the entire process has provided valuable practical experience. I am now far more comfortable and familiar with using Tableau Prep for data cleaning, and Tableau and Datawrapper for visualizing data. I am also much more critical and conscious of design elements like labels, text, and color, which are elements I previously overlooked when creating graphics. 

If I could change one element of this project, it would be the timeline. Starting the project earlier would allow for more time to receive more feedback on our progress and implement necessary revisions, which would definitely enhance the quality of the final product.
