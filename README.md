# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! My name is Vivian Ma (she/her), and I'm a student from the Master of Arts Management (MAM) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I come from a background of art history and statistics, and I'm interested in exploring how data analytics help decision-making in arts and cultural organizations.

# What I hope to learn
- I want to learn good practices and principles of data visualization.
- I hope to get myself more familiarized with data visualization softwares, like Tableau and Datawrapper.

# Portfolio
## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
In this assignment, I created a heatmap to visualize general government debt of different countries from 1995 to 2019.

## Assignment: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
In this assignment, I performed a critique on an existing data visualization and provided a redesign using the same dataset to improve comprehension clarity.

## Final project
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
[Part III](final-project-part-three)

Using multiple data visualizations, my final project explores the journey of a tomato—from production and trade to its diverse forms of consumption—in order to showcase the large scale of this process and the tomato’s ubiquity in everyday life, with a call-to-action on preventing food loss informed by my data analysis findings.
