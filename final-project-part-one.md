# Life of a Tomato: Tracking Tomatoes from Production to Consumption in the United States - Final Project Part 1
## Outline
### One-Sentence Summary
My final project explores the journey of a tomato—from production and trade to its diverse forms of consumption—in order to show the large scale of this process and the tomato’s ubiquity in everyday life. 

### Rationale behind the Project
I chose this topic because tomatoes are my all-time favorite food. I can’t imagine going a week without buying something made from them, whether fresh tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, canned tomatoes, or tomato sauce. This personal connection made me realize how essential and widespread tomatoes are in diets worldwide, and they appear in countless forms and dishes. As I think deeper about the tomatoes sitting in my fridge, I also recognize their journey is far more complex than just being purchased from a nearby store. From the tomatoes’ perspective, this journey involves being planted, harvested, transported, sold, and ultimately consumed by people in different places. There is an entire story behind tomatoes waiting to be uncovered, and I’m excited to tell it using every piece of data I can gather. 

I envision this project as a fun and compelling discovery that draws attention to a common element of everyday life. The visualizations should spark curiosity, making viewers want to stop and dig deeper into something they usually take for granted, as small as a tomato.

### Project Structure
The story will begin with a personal anecdote about my own tomato consumption to create a sense of familiarity and relevance for the audience. From there, I’ll transition to the global production of tomatoes as the starting point of the journey. While the focus of my project is on tomatoes that enter and are consumed in the United States, I’ll use global production data to show where American tomatoes might come from, since they are planted in many countries.

Next, the narrative will shift to the U.S. tomato trade, examining how tomatoes move through import and export channels before reaching consumers. Then, I’ll explore U.S. tomato consumption using two metrics from US Department of Agriculture (USDA): Food Availability and Loss-Adjusted Food Availability (LAFA). Food Availability estimates how much food is accessible for consumption in the U.S. (including the Armed Forces overseas) by tracking the flow of tomatoes through the market (U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Availability (Per Capita) Data System - Food Availability Documentation). LAFA further adjusts these figures by subtracting spoilage, plate waste, and other losses to better reflect actual consumption (U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Availability (Per Capita) Data System - Loss-Adjusted Food Availability Documentation). Additionally, I’ll incorporate tomato pricing data to provide a more comprehensive view of its consumption in the U.S.

Ultimately, the story should reveal key insights as the journey concludes. For now, beyond illustrating the vast scale of this process and emphasizing how integral tomatoes are to daily life, I need to complete my data visualizations to uncover any additional messages.

## The data
For my final project, I will use six datasets: one from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and five from the USDA. Because some of the sources don’t update their data annually, there is some variation in the years covered by each dataset, but I ensured they all include data from at least the past five years to keep the analysis relevant.

The FAO dataset provides the gross production index for tomatoes from 2020–2022, including geographic regions and production volumes in tons. This will allow me to visualize global tomato production in recent years and track any changes. 

The Vegetables and Dry Pulses Trade Data form USDA covers monthly U.S. trade data for tomatoes and tomato-based products from 2023–2025, including import and export figures, trade locations, and commodity types such as fresh tomatoes, juice, sauce, and ketchup. It not only highlights the wide range of tomato-related products available in the United States, but also provides insight into where these products originate and where they are distributed.

All Vegetables – Average Prices and Tomatoes-Average Retail Price Per Pound and Per Cup Equivalent, both from USDA, focus on pricing: one compares average vegetable prices in 2022 across 93 types, and the other details tomato prices by category (fresh and canned) for the same year. These will help assess tomato accessibility and price variation along its journey to consumption.

The last two USDA datasets, Vegetables (All Uses) (Food Availability) and Vegetables (LAFA), track tomato consumption in the U.S. The Food Availability dataset covers 1993–2022, while LAFA spans 1970–2022. Together, they provide insights into overall trends in availability and consumption after accounting for waste and spoilage.

Together, these datasets will enable a comprehensive analysis of tomato production, trade, pricing, and consumption. I believe as I explore these datasets deeper, there will be other relevant insights that I can add to the main messages I want to convey.

## Method and medium
I plan to use Procreate to design some visually appealing icons and graphics that complement the story and theme of tomatoes. Tableau will be my primary tool for data visualization, and I will integrate these hand-drawn graphics into the visualizations to make them interesting to look at and interpret. Finally, the interactive deliverable will be published using Shorthand.
